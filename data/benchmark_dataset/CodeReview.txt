This is what I figured even if we define a column type as integer it is still allowed by sqlalchemy to have strings!

OK, thanks.  The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want.   When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same.  When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!  When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c "You, too, could be using RDTSCP!". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.  I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.  So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.	0.0

well, since we're doing this, might as well do this instead, since it's cleaner and looks better (and sanitized).          elements = getattr(self._conn, class_name)(ElementName=element_name)         data = self._get_first_item(elements)  And before you dismiss the usage of getattr, That's actually how wmi namespaces work: the __getattr__ method is overriden and it will lookup and cache that class_name and return it, as it does not have it defined.

On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery).  But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously.  This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches).  I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So, you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

Yikes, we are starting an RPC for every row in the table?  My concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server.  If a user has 50 items in their dashboard, which many do, this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes.  Worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs.  I would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id, Whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.	0.0

If you dig into the code, at some point you will reach a very strange statement (a couple of calls from setCacheSize), qMax(qMin(.....), 25).

I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects.  Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place.  We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects).  These constants feel  more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class.  I have some more changes, which I will push, which move them out of the Branch class completely.  I am willing to update the comment here if need be, but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that "naive" comment should get in the way of that.	0.0

OH, I forgot your that CL :-) However STLPORT_WHITELIST isn't defined yet at this point. In config.mk it loads envsetup.mk (which eventually loads the product makefiles) before it defines STLPORT_WHITELIST.

Removing onboard devices instead of setting them to off can break the chipset configuration. This is the entire reason for this stuff to be in a devicetree.cb and to make the static.c to point to the correct setup functions. These devices are always on the board and the chip configuration will enable and disable (and hide) them based on the platform configuration and the device tree.  Without this, everything would be a normal pci device enumeration and coreboot would be much much simpler...

We should move this to some other module since it has very little to do with SIMD, and it was only a hack for a single architecture.

magnus, to write something along the lines of this is the number of sets of the most frequently written output type per frame set. the best default will need some experimentation. ideally this would be a user-configurable option, but it is not clear whether a (hidden) command-line option would be best (or env var), and not clear whether anybody would really use it in practice.

As of now, some caller assumes that the returned ref is not nil when the returned err is nil. When this assumption is not valid, as the original code shows, subsequent actions on the returned ref would cause NPE and lead to GOXDCR crashes, which caused the issue in MB-18266.   Returning a metadataNotFound err here is more correct conceptually, since this code is called from query APIs for remote cluster refs, and not being able to find the ref is an error condition. It will result in more consistent and predictable behavior -- the aforementioned issue will no longer occur.	0.0

Actually, it seems my comment isn't quite correct. Windows has strerror(3), and it behaves like you would expect... for the C library.  The Windows API calls essentially have their own errno that is retrieved by GetLastError(), and these error codes are not the same as those used by errno, and thus use the gross API (FormatMessage https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa908810.aspx) instead.

I don't think the comparison with the SshCommands (or RestViews) is fair. For SSH commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters.  For project rename tasks it may be (and probably is) critical in which order the steps are executed. It is not just a set of tasks that can be done in any order. For a critical command as project rename the order of tasks execution should be explicit. At least it has to be documented. Right now, one has to look in the TaskModule, then in the DynamicSet and find out that, internally, it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator() will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list. And this is not even documented/guaranteed behavior of the DynamicSet.	-1.0

Yes.  Actually, look at what I just merged to master with the query operators, in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt.  You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted:    is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2  If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true.  By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.  So the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.  We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.	0.0

I thought a little about this. Basically it should work like this:  ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image, use the ImageId to list/display the image.  ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique), then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId, just as git does with short hashes).  Now considering this last case if we set ImageName = ImageId, then the displayed name would be something like "myisoimagename.iso (myisoim)".  Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all.  Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set.	0.0

"with the transition to ORM all we should care of is the real identifiers of this class, which is id" Ã¢â‚¬â€ that's considered to be not true. Since we(at least I don't) do not know (yet?), which operations will be performed on entities, we cannot tell, what we have to compare. Namely, we have to know first, whether these entities will be processed also with unset id when stored in collections, if so, then comparing just ids spells crazy results. Usually it's recommended to compare some unique business id instead of or along with db ID. See Hibernate recommendation related to id generation / object identity.  Ok, I'll regenerate equals&hashcode using these two fields.  Note: this syntax is Java7 syntax, with direct field access, allowing comparing classes with their descendants (the last thing is necessary due to hibernate design).	-1.0

s/exit/continue/  Exiting the loop doesn't do a final update of v. The write to conflict with this read must happen during the setup for a subsequent iteration.   This one does bother me. To be clear, what's going on is:  v = a[0] go func() { x = v }() v = a[1] go func() { y = v }()  There is no race involving the second goroutine, since its read is guaranteed to happen after the write of v = a[1]. The race is between the x = v and the v = a[1]. I don't understand why the race detector does not detect that misordering 100% of the time. I filed #10589 about this. At least this fixes the build so that we can detect future breakages while Dmitriy thinks about this one.	-1.0

FYI this probably doesn't always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use "Y".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this.  Can't this statement also be written as an UPDATE:    UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order = 'Y'   WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = 'Y';    UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category = 'Y'   WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category = 'Y';  This should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements.

I started replacing C0 with c[0] because I didn't see a significant advantage of having C0 available. But then I saw this and realized this AI naming is used in some other places. And it might be helpful to have the I..M index.

And I thought it would be nice to have C and A by consistent. So I also created CO..C2 not just AI..AM. I think consistency with the previous name is more important than consistency to the variable name. But it doesn't really matter to me.	0.0

In which case, shouldn't the code just say that all other open projects should already have their SDK's pointing to the SDK used by the IDE?  i.e., now that we do this, we shouldn't have to modify other projects, only this project since all others should already be in sync.  The fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesn't make sense.

I thought the point of the platform file is to make it easier by requiring only one option. Of course the user can also simply use "CC=icc CXX=icpc CFLAGS=-mmic CXXFLAGS=-mmic".

I still think you also need to check that the $bi->get('blocktype') is allowed for $artefacttype->name.

So we need to check not just if the plugin is correct (eg = 'file') but that the artefacttype is of the correct subset for the block (eg 'audio, video') for the block instance (eg 'internalmedia')	0.0

Patch Set 1:  Thanks for your reviews.  To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning.  Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think).  Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community.

Hi Nigel,  To expand on what Tobias said, when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name.

The size here is now just the size of the struct, hence the names (old/new) will not be a part of the dict.  Further, dict_set_bin, takes in a pointer, that it strores in the xattr/dict and later is freed when this dict is destroyed. In the case of passing a pointer which is a structure containing another pointer, the dict routines cannot encode this into the dict.  Overall, as info is passed to be stored as a dict, the above mechanism of allocating a pointer within info and passing this would fail to send these values across and also leak memory for the allocated info->buffer.	0.0

Cosmetic: According to last changes related to tvb_captured_length and tvb_reported_length it is good point to start thinking about "reported" case (btsnoop format provide both frame length). In "reported" case we can have only part of frame: for example first 2 bytes. This dissector will fail at this line, so nothing will be dissected, but if you move lines 131-140,(169)171-181 directly before place when it will be use then we can dissect some fields. "context" can be filled somewhere about line current 202, "rf_channel" can be put between lines 144-145, "aa_offenses" can be fetch after 170 or where "context" is filled, the problem is "flags", but after moved it after line 147 you are able to decode "btle_rf_channel" field etc.	0.0
I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free.  Another concern is that when it is called by MethodInliner, actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by MethodInliner, not all the modified methods since last DeadCodeElimination. The result would be the same, but it may do unnecessary work in MethodInliner.	0.0

You are mixing two different use cases. Use case 1:    beginTransaction()   commit()  this works, because beginTransaction() set autoCommit=false and commit is successful even though nothing to commit.  Use case 2:    open Connection with autoCommit=true   commit()  Evidently, this doesn't work on all Jdbc dialects supported by Gerrit. E. g. this doesn't work on PostgreSQL for the same reason why rollback() doesn't work. To see the failure, remove this if-guard above and run PostgreSQL unit test:    testRollbackNoTransaction()  it is failing with:    Cannot commit when autoCommit is enabled.  or some such.	-1.0

changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code, too)  I had it mostly coded with date serial numbers, but had to make functions that are available for class Date. I could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the sc/addin/analysis module, a module that I would rather move entirely to the 'normal' calc function module once the Excel-analysis-addin can be considered obsolete. IMHO that would reduce the complexity of the calc-function code. I will peg Date to date serial number conversion as a toDo item on my lo-task stack.	0.0

I don't think this is the way we should do it. The routine execute_x86cpuid is obviously *x86*-specific, and that is why it is only defined on certain x86 platforms.

We will gradually get more detection routines, so it does not make sense to have all routines available on all architectures, but usually non-functional.	-1.0

since the spec says that the same format should be used for both critical options and extensions, I named the structures: optionsTuple, optionsTupleValue, and optionsTupleEmptyValue (I believe I needed the latter to marshal extensions with empty values where there is no double length prefix) - starting at Line 89 of certs.go.   I used them in the marshalTuples and parseTuples.  Regarding unmarshaling - please take a look at the current version, I wanted to use the same function for critical options and extensions, and to handle properly empty and non-empty values I believe some "low-level" handling is needed.  I used an instance of optionsTupleValue structure to pass to Unmarshal (Line 186).	0.0

I remember seeing error like "Lproc: Attempting to register osc more than once" when trying to mount lustre file system on server node. Looks like we have this logic to avoid re-creating osc proc entry in osp_mod_init but its counterpart is missing in osc_setup(). So if we have osp loaded before osc, we get the failure inserting osc module.  The error now gets hidden with this patch because lprocfs_seq_register() only warns about it and creates duplicated entry in parent's subdir link. Then subsequent lookup only finds the newly created entry and it can cause random failures.	0.0

why do we json_encode() $scopeData here? We do not do this in the base class. Furthermore it is already serialized.  The only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the Tree.thisScript stuff.

If neither applies, then still the question remains, if there's a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding (and copyiing) the complete method from the base class?	-1.0
In my opinion this function is not required. ArrayIndexItems function can return one more array called counts (count for each entry).

On HTTP /abandon and /restore accept no body. This results in null being passed to the apply() method, which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input.  I think its common to call /abandon and /restore with no input. Your tests are certainly showing that.

That's a bit of a philosophical discussion. I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range.  One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)  For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. Thus, I like the idea of merely testing what we actually need, and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we don't need, that should fundamentally be a good thing(TM)!	0.0

I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article.

Use of first-child might invite us to use last-child and other selectors based on the idea. I do think we should be avoid nth-of-type and nth-child at all costs but I'd expect first-child and last-child to be less evil!  That said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and VE to catch up.

Hi, Correct me if i'm wrong - but, we have 2 instances of commands in the flow you described. This means they do not share state. The change done by Arik adds messages on the canDoActionMessages() collection of each one of the commands. Not sure how you're going to have this mix.	-1.0

You can actually remove this entirely - I needed it to work around a bug in lcb when connecting to a non-standard port (i.e. ./cluster_run running on port 9000 instead of 8091). For use in perfrunner with standard packages we probably want CCCP.	0.0

Hi Bob,  I think the setting of screen resolution is not important as it makes no different when I changed it to smaller or larger size therefore I chose the medium size (1024x768).

I see your point, there is place for improving my original suggestion. The problem with your current code and new suggestion is: you don't respect visibility during the whole loop. But the outcome of the loop is entirely useless when current change is say a draft or when the user doesn't have ACL to submit a change for a project.  Example: if this code is merged as is or with your new suggestion, and you (you don't have +2 ACL on gerrit-review, right?) would open a change that belongs to a topic, that is shared by 1 million of changes, then you would iterate through all 1 mil. of changes, just to say visible = false, right?	-1.0

cbk->mask will only contain bricks where the request has been sent. A read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on cbk->mask set, so the & is not needed. However, for writes (that also send the requests to bricks being healed), doing the & will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation, even if the operation succeeded. I think this is not correct.	-1.0

> I think it's cleaner. We do not have to re-implement and maintain different versions start-needed-srv in each script. Just one "vdsm_init_common.sh --start-needed-srv" to rule them all.  Here we disagree.  But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before.  When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic.  At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies.  So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1]  So we left with rhel only to handle...  This is why I do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic.  [1] https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts	-1.0

Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization).  Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).	0.0
Right, changing an SwField, which is part of the document model during export is bad. An export operation should just read the document model and serialize it in some format.

Josh, my proposal is to see boot as a helper for deploy driver (or to any other interface or anyone else) rather than to see it as a separate interface.   Boot should just take care of getting the bare metal booted to the required environment - whether for ironic to perform an operation OR to boot the user-requested image.    Thinking in these lines, I would think boot interface should refrain from participating in cleaning.  Boot interface should participate in cleaning only if it had something to clean up on the bare metal node that would take a lot of time - in my mind there isn't anything.

We take an "error_list" from the framework here, but "message" is passed as an argument. Looking at how message is constructed, this also could be generated here (there is no need to pass it through argument).  So either both message and error_list are this function arguments, or none of them.	0.0
Is this the right API? An alternative is:  func If(s RuneSet, tTrue, tFalse Transformer) Transformer  type RuneSet interface {   Contains(rune) bool }  and have unicode.RangeTable implement this interface.  If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib.  But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them. Your phone number Ranges example seems a bit contrived, and again, I'd just for/range over the string for that particular task.

If you want varargs, you could add an addAll() method:   HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  hrc.addAll(hr1, hr2);  or with a Collection or Iterable as argument:   HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  hrc.addAll(Arrays.asList(hr1, hr2));  Note that Sencha has not felt the need to add such collection/varargs to their GroupingHandlerRegistration: http://docs.sencha.com/gxt/3/com/sencha/gxt/core/shared/event/GroupingHandlerRegistration.html  Similar for GWT-P's registerHandler on their PresenterWidget base class: http://arcbees.github.io/GWTP/javadoc/apidocs/com/gwtplatform/mvp/client/HandlerContainerImpl.html#registerHandler(com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.HandlerRegistration)	0.0

We would prefer to keep this.

Just because your implementation may not do this, we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things.  Couldn't you just remember the first sequence number your RILD connection received?  Then you know the number of requests you've received.	-1.0

When you swap a KEY_RIGHT for a KEY_LEFT in RTL, that's because you're interested in the "start of the line" (which is on the left in LTR) rather than the left vs. right; so in the "case KEY_LEFT", the comment could say "start of the line, no special RTL handling".	0.0

This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period.  Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here.  One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.	-1.0

the previous event may not be traceEvGoCreate, like this scenario: when trace start goroute is in syscall and then exitsyscall and finally goStart.

Looking at all *Listener.java files in our source tree I see the following two cases:  * a listener is just notified that an event happened but cannot do anything to prevent/block that event. In that case the listener doesn't throw any checked exception(s). Examples: GitReferenceUpdatedListener, HeadUpdatedListener, AuditListener, ...  * a listener can block the event. In this case the listener throws a checked exception which is on the same level of abstraction as the listener interface. Examples: CommitValidationListener throws CommitValidationException, MergeValidationListener throws MergeValidationException, ...  Since this listener is not intended to validate/block a group membership change(s) it belongs to the first category and shouldn't throw any exception.	0.0

Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates.  Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried.  The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter.  (Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)	0.0

Ah, ok. Let me explain a bit: The USBIP server/client is split into two parts. On the server side, there's an userspace daemon (usbipd) and a kernel module usbip-host.ko. The client has a userspace tool (usbip) and a virtual usb hcd vhci-hcd.ko.   So, get_usbip_message_len is split in the same manner.  The Device List, Import, .... Request/Response stuff (which has a protocl version 0x111) is the user space portion. The usbip-host.ko and vhci-hcd.ko part (aka URBs handling, version = 0x0000) is part of the kernel. You are right, I'll add comment which explains why the function got so convoluted.	0.0

But then there's no need to re-define the gwt-maven-plugin's dependencies. So either we use ${gwtVersion} as the gwt-maven-plugin version and we remove the plugin dependencies, or we keep it that way, with identical but "unrelated" versions for GWT and the gwt-maven-plugin.  I'd happily go with the former (which would simplify the POM and aligns with what people should write unless they really need different versions of GWT and the plugin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ e.g. they use a patched GWT, or a patched plugin, or the plugin hasn't yet been released for the version of GWT they want to use, or the plugin has had a bugfix release), but it makes it a bit harder to test the WebAppCreator with a GWT RC (not yet pushed to Central), where the plugin hasn't yet been released (because it cannot update its GWT dependencies yet).

Patch Set 2:  Liron, so lets think: Reconstruct flow: Go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect.

No need for additional method that u introduced. Where it is 99% percent common. You already introduced a method that at some flow should return only true and complicated a very simple code.

That was actually the original code. If dest <= src and you're only copying one byte at a time, if you start from the top you'll never overwrite the data you haven't copied yet. Otherwise, you have to start from the other end. *dest++ = *src memcpy;, but memcpy is not *dest++ = *src;.  To quote from the pretty short man page:  The memory areas must not overlap.  That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy, and that would make the normal case work like it always has.  But I'm working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and ARM. In order to test them I'm going to implement them in the chromeos tree, and then to transfer them over I've put together a big series of patches to upstream so they should just apply.	0.0

Conversion was done for binary files to be stored in earlier formats.

Patch Set 4:  Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution.   Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use "checkLanguageAccess" only if the TCA for the table has a "languageField".  "pages" is not such a table, because there is "pages_language_overlay". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the "Original Language" is to remove the permissions for editing table "pages" and only allow "pages_language_overlay". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794  This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.  Similar problem we have in the "List view", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more "aggressive" than in the GUI.  Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has "edit permissions" on the "pages" table - just like TCEmain also does.  As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on "language restriction permissions on pages" in the first place before fixing the GUI.  I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.  Maybe in your research you find out different aspects than I did or you can prove me wrong as I have only touched the "surface" of the whole complex. Please let me know!	-1.0

Add:      When you copy a manifest object, the new object is a "normal" object -- not a copy of the     manifest. Instead it is a concatenation of all the segment objects.

If you specify metadata on the request to copy     the object (either the PUT or the COPY), the metadata overwrites any conflicting keys on the     target (new) object.	0.0

Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like:  """ Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.  When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.  Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them). """  The PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST isn't directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I don't think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code). It's probably better to avoid mentioning it, or add a note like "ideally, use PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST if running on Vista or higher"	0.0

I would love to do this. The problem is that all SSH information is only available inside of the SSH project and the server project which implements the REST endpoints doesn't have a dependency on it. Since we don't want this dependency I don't know how to implement it.  On the other hand, if you have SSH enabled and you are interested in the SSH summary and connections you can retrieve this information via SSH. The REST endpoints are mainly important for installations where SSH is not available, but in this case there is also no SSH summary and no SSH connections. This is why I'm okay with the current solution of ignoring the SSH stuff in the REST endpoint.	0.0

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this  (2 inline comments)  I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin.  The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it.  The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.  Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag.   Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function.	-1.0

If we were doing attribute-level access control, it might make more sense to me, but entity level for tenant-id RBAC is redundant to the db queries to me.	-1.0

dev_find_slot() explicitly returns a 0 (yeah, it's the same as a NULL).  Maybe that should be changed to return a NULL, but at this point, I think checking for 0 is reasonable.  yes, if it's 0, we still reach the code.  I've changed it to not dereference it before checking it though.	0.0
OUString::replaceAll does not modify the OUString but returns a new OUString instead. this means that when converting an existing String *Replace* call you need to assign the returned value to the original string.  you should get a warning about an "unused result" here but strangely i'm not seeing a warning with gcc 4.7, no idea why... at least the Clang tinderbox caught the problem.  fixed in commit 03a381eaa58d77cf26dfa8d916d1ecda865c1937	0.0

when i was suggesting flipping the boolean, i did also wonder whether we wouldn't be better off just passing in the length. if it's <= 0, interpret that as "don't know"? that would then move 8192 down out of the callers too.  or... i really like the way you went for readFully rather than implementing the missing read()s, which is what i'd actually imagined. how about we go one further and just have a static fromFile or similar? then it could do the stat, and have everything it needs. you could even use Libcore.os open/fstat/read/close to avoid the RandomAccessFile without increasing the overall amount of code.	0.0

When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively.  The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something.  Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time.  Imo that is more important. See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover	0.0

I like calling *somewhere* rather than inline policy-conditional code. I don't like that I have still exposed policy-specific's in line 528 :/    newest_file = durable_file or data_file or ts_file  I nearly changed this to pass the ondisk file set to is_obsolete() and let that method take care of (a) determining the policy-specific newest file and then (b) determining if the file under test is obsolete. But backed off because there would be a slight loss of optimisation because as it stands, the loop is never executed if there is *no* newest file.  I guess a call to a policy.get_newest(file_set) would do it. But what I'd really like to do is have a policy.get_ondisk_files() method return the wanted set and optionally the unwanted set as result of a single iteration over the dir listing.	-1.0
